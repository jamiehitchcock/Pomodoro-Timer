## Pomodoro Timer

A timer created for the pomodoro productivity method of 25 mins of study, to 5 mins of break. This is created in React.js and allows users to set the amount of time for both values. The time will then countdown and show the remaining time in the progress bar. An alarm will sound when the timer has expired. It will then begin the alternate timer and repeat.
